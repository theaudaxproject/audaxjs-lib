# AudaxJS (audaxjs-lib)
[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/audaxjs-lib.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/audaxjs-lib)


The pure JavaScript Audax library for node.js and browsers.


## Features
- Clean: Pure JavaScript, concise code, easy to read.
- Compatible: Works on Node.js and all modern browsers.
- Powerful: Support for advanced features, such as multi-sig, HD Wallets.
- Secure: Strong random number generation, trusted developers.
- Principled: No support for browsers with crap RNG (IE < 11)
- Standardized: Node community coding style, Browserify, Node's stdlib and Buffers.
- Fast: Optimized code, uses typed arrays instead of byte arrays for performance.
- Experiment-friendly: Audax Mainnet and Testnet support.


## Should I use this in production?
If you are thinking of using the master branch of this library in production, **stop**.
Master is not stable; it is our development branch, and [only tagged releases may be classified as stable](https://github.com/theaudaxproject/audaxjs-lib/tags).


## Installation
``` bash
npm install audaxjs-lib
```

## Setup
### Node.js
``` javascript
var audaxjs = require('audaxjs-lib')
```

### Browser
If you're familiar with how to use browserify, ignore this and proceed normally.
These steps are advisory only,  and may not be suitable for your application.

[Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) is assumed to be installed for these steps.

For your project, create an `index.js` file
``` javascript
let audaxjs = require('audaxjs-lib')

// your code here
function myFunction () {
	return audaxjs.ECPair.makeRandom().toWIF()
}

module.exports = {
	myFunction
}
```

Now, to compile for the browser:
``` bash
browserify index.js --standalone foo > app.js
```

You can now put `<script src="app.js" />` in your web page,  using `foo.myFunction` to create a new Audax private key.

**NOTE**: If you uglify the javascript, you must exclude the following variable names from being mangled: `BigInteger`, `ECPair`, `Point`.
This is because of the function-name-duck-typing used in [typeforce](https://github.com/dcousens/typeforce).

Example:
``` bash
uglifyjs ... --mangle --reserved 'BigInteger,ECPair,Point'
```

**NOTE**: This library tracks Node LTS features,  if you need strict ES5,  use [`--transform babelify`](https://github.com/babel/babelify) in conjunction with your `browserify` step (using an [`es2015`](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/) preset).

**NOTE**: If you expect this library to run on an iOS 10 device, ensure that you are using [buffer@5.0.5](https://github.com/feross/buffer/pull/155) or greater.
